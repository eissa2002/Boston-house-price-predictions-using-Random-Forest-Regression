# My project predicts Boston house prices using random forest regression.Using the Boston Housing dataset, it involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. Evaluation metrics include mean squared error and R-squared value. The code is in Python, and popular data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn are used. It serves as a reference for regression problems in data science.
